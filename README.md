# Machine-Learning-Project-
In this project, a dissolution problem was solved using AIDS Virus Infection Prediction dataset. Decision programs were modeled using K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests and the accuracy rates were met. The results showed that Artificial Neural Networks model showed higher accuracy.
